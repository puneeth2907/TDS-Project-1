# TDS - Project 1
- I scraped the data using the GitHub API by setting up a personal access token, searching for users in a specific city(Tokyo) with over a set number of followers(200), and retrieving their repositories, all implemented in Python with the `requests` library in a Google Colab notebook.
- An intriguing discovery was that users marked as "not hireable" tend to follow more people than those classified as "hireable", suggesting differences in engagement strategies.
- Developers should focus on creating more repositories and crafting detailed bios, as these actions can attract more followers and enhance their visibility within the GitHub community.

The Users data and Repositories data had been added to the users and repositories files in .csv format respectively, and the analysis of process worked is in the Google Colab notebook but uploaded as Jupyter File(.ipynb). All these 3 files can be found in this repository.
