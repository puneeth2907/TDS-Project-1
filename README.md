# TDS - Project 1
- I scraped the data using the GitHub API by setting up a personal access token, searching for users in a specific city(Tokyo) with over a set number of followers(200), and retrieving their repositories, all implemented in Python with the `requests` library in a Google Colab notebook.
- An intriguing discovery was that users marked as "not hireable" tend to follow more people than those classified as "hireable", suggesting differences in engagement strategies.
- Developers should focus on creating more repositories and crafting detailed bios, as these actions can attract more followers and enhance their visibility within the GitHub community.
